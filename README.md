# Overview
We are analyzing NYC Citibike to see if it's possible to do a bike-sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. We were able to get an angel investor that is interested in investing if we have a business plan. We want to use Tableau to make it easier to understand our findings because visualization is going to help non-analytical people understand.

# Results
  - Use Tableau to generate several visualizations.
  - Generate visualization of Top Bike Stations for the Start & End Journey.
  - Generate visualization of Checkout times for users.
  - Generate visualization of Checkout times by Gender.
  - Generate visualization of Trips by Weekday for each hour.
  - Generate visualization of Trips by Gender.
  - Generate visualization of Trips by Gender by weekday.
  - Generate visualization of Bike Repair
  - Create a story with all visualizations with descriptions of the results.
  
# Summary
In conclusion, we were able to generate a story using our findings of the citibike data for the month of August to utilize it for creating a business plan. When you look at the slide for who takes the most trips during the week and at what time. As we can see males(1) are more likely to use the bikes during the week than women(2) and unknown(0). They have peak hours in the morning at 7:00 - 9:00 and 5:00 - 7:00 pm, which is understandable. Men usually go to work during these hours in the morning and return home. What was interesting is that unknown(0) don't have a peak hour throughout the weekdays but are more likely to use the bikes during the weekends between 11 am and 5 pm.  Another interesting finding is that those who are using the bikes are more likely subscribers for males(1) and women(2) but for unknown (0) it is the customers that use the bikes throughout the week than subscribers.
